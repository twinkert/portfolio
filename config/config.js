	title: "Who I am",
	description: [
		"I graduated with a Computer Science degree from both Montgomery College (A.A.) in 2019 and the University of Maryland: College Park (B.S.) in 2022 with a minor concentration of Technology Entreprenuership. I interned twice for NASA in two seperate programs; NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center located in Greenbelt, Maryland and NASA's Kennedy Space Center located in Merritt Island, Florida. In addition to my internship experiences, I worked as a data analyst for Wellington Finch and Sinclair LLC while I was in school as well as after graduating.",

		"I am eager to delve deeper into AWS Cloud to enhance my current machine learning expertise. By mastering AWS services like Amazon SageMaker and EC2, I aim to scale and optimize model training efficiently. With a focus on deploying models as APIs using AWS Lambda and integrating AI-driven services like Amazon Rekognition and Polly, I envision creating innovative applications that harness the power of cloud computing and cutting-edge machine learning algorithms. Through this pursuit, I aspire to push the boundaries of computer vision, natural language processing, and predictive modeling, ultimately making a positive impact in the field of AI.",

		"When Iâ€™m not programming, I like to make tea, practice linear algebra, build cars, and play soccer. I think the most interesting thing about me outside of programming is that my engineering mindset has made me so facinated with doing the impossible on cars. Using my entrepreneurship skills from school combined with my problem solving abilities, I was able to fabricate and weld together the only turbo manifold available at the time for BMW's 3 series (328i 2005-2011) to replicate and sell to consumers."
